      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>Welcome to the Team Page! When we decided on our project we tossed around a few ideas and then ultimately decided to try and re-create NewYork Times fun word game: wordle, but instead as "Codle!" We wanted to create a fun game to help us study code terminology.</p>

      <h3>Ben Carter</h3>
      <p>Howdy viewer! <br> Aside from loving programming, I am a long-time worker in the technology space. I love to ride my bicycle as far as it will take me. When it isn’t cycling weather you’ll need to head to the mountains to catch me, as I spend as much of the winter as possible skiing, or touring in the backcountry. I live in West Seattle, with my lovely wife (a Code Fellows Alum!) and my best cat buddy Apollo. And soon we will be welcoming a new kitten into the house!</p>

      <p>Hello! Excited to have you here. <br>I'm Eden, and I'm just a Baby Software Developer, and a trained Virology Research Scientist. <br>I love video games and art of all sorts, including but not limited to drawing, cooking, and crafting.<br> I'm also always interested in trying new activities, some of my favorites that I've tried are skateboarding, rock climbing and aerial yoga! <br> Finally I think a large part of myself is my love for animals, I have two cats and I'm always eager to meet and make new animal friends. <br>I hope you enjoyed our CODLE program!</p>
